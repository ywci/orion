OrionCore is a RV32I pipelined processor, featuring separate modules for each stage. The interfaces for OrionCore include instruction memory (imem) and data memory (dmem). OrionCore contains three registers (pcReg, instReg, and stallReg) that store the current program counter, the current instruction, and a stall flag, respectively.

The following 6 modules are included in the OrionCore processor:

- OrionIFU: the fetch unit, which includes a branch predictor unit sub-module (OrionBPU). The interfaces for OrionIFU include instruction memory (imem), the program counter (pc), the instruction (instruction), a stall indicator (stall), a flush indicator (flush).
- OrionIDU: the decode unit.
- OrionEXU: the execution unit.
- OrionMem: the memory access unit.
- OrionWB: the write-back unit.
- OrionRegFile: the register file.

For OrionBPU, OrionBPU uses a bimodal prediction scheme, which is a simple yet effective method for branch prediction. In this scheme, a table of 2-bit saturating counters is used to predict the outcome of branch instructions. Each entry in the table corresponds to a unique branch instruction, identified by the lower bits of the branch instruction's address. The 2-bit counter is used to make the prediction: '00' and '01' predict not-taken, while '10' and '11' predict taken. The counter is incremented when a branch is taken and decremented when it is not. The interface of OrionBPU includes the following 6 signals:

- pc: This input is the program counter of the current instruction.
- inst: This input is the current instruction being executed.
- stall: This input indicates whether the BPU should be stalled or not.
- flush: This input indicates whether the BPU should be flushed or not.
- taken: This output indicates whether the BPU predicts a taken branch or not.
- target: This output indicates the predicted target address of the branch instruction.

The CtrlSignals class represents the control signals used by the decode stage of the OrionCore processor. CtrlSignals includes the following 11 signals:

- regWrite: A Boolean value that indicates whether the destination register should be written to.
- memRead: A Boolean value that indicates whether the memory should be read.
- memWrite: A Boolean value that indicates whether the memory should be written to.
- memToReg: A Boolean value that indicates whether the result should come from memory or the ALU.
- aluOp: An integer value that specifies the operation to be performed by the ALU.
- op1Sel: An integer value that selects the first operand for the ALU.
- op2Sel: An integer value that selects the second operand for the ALU.
- branch: A Boolean value that indicates whether the instruction is a branch.
- jump: A Boolean value that indicates whether the instruction is a jump.
- jal: A Boolean value that indicates whether the instruction is a jal.
- jalr: A Boolean value that indicates whether the instruction is a jalr.

For OrionIDU, its decode logic is mainly provided by a sub-module named OrionIDUCtrl. The interface of OrionIDU includes the following 8 signals:

- inst: This input is the current instruction to be decoded.
- ctrl: This output is the control signals generated by the OrionDEUCtrl sub-module based on the instruction.
- rs1: This output is the index of the first source register.
- rs2: This output is the index of the second source register.
- rd: This output is the index of the destination register.
- imm: This output is the immediate value used by the instruction.
- jalOffset: This output is the offset value used by the JAL instruction.
- branchOffset: This output is the offset value used by the branch instructions.

For OrionEXU, OrionEXU is the execution unit of OrionCore that performs arithmetic and logical operations, memory address calculation, and branch target address calculation. OrionEXU contains 3 sub-modules that enable these functions, including OrionALU, OrionBranchCalc, and OrionMemCalc.

OrionALU: This sub-module performs arithmetic and logical operations, based on the operation specified by the control signals. It uses the two input operands, the result of which is then passed to the OrionMemCalc sub-module or the OrionWB sub-module based on the control signals.

OrionBranchCalc: This sub-module calculates the target address of a branch or jump instruction using the current program counter and the offset value obtained from the OrionIDU. It uses the output of the OrionALU and the control signals to determine whether the branch is taken or not.

OrionMemCalc: This sub-module calculates the address to access the memory and determines whether the memory operation is a read or write operation, based on the control signals. It uses the output of the OrionALU and the control signals to perform the memory operation.

The interface of OrionEXU includes the following 15 signals:

- pc: This input is the current program counter, which is used to calculate the target address of a jump or branch instruction.
- ctrl: TThis input signal is of type CtrlSignals, which carries the control signals generated by the OrionIDU module, specifying the operation to be performed.
- imm: This input is the immediate value used by the instruction.
- memData: This input is the data read from the data memory.
- rs1Data: This input is the value of the first source register, which is used in arithmetic or logical operations.
- rs2Data: This input is the value of the second source register, which is used in arithmetic or logical operations.
- aluResult: This output is the result of the arithmetic or logical operation performed by the ALU.
- branchTarget: This output is the calculated branch target address used by the OrionIFU module..
- branchTaken: This output is a Boolean signal indicating whether the branch should be taken.
- writeReg: This output is the index of the destination register.
- regWrite: This output indicates whether the result should be written back to a register. If set to true, the result is passed to the OrionWB sub-module for writing to the register file.
- memAddr: This output is the memory address for the memory operation.
- memWrite: This outout is a signal indicating whether a memory write operation should be performed.
- memData: This output is the data to be written back to the register file by the OrionWB module.
- pcPlus4: This output is the program counter plus 4.

For OrionMEM, the 'mem' interface is used to communicate with memory. The 'mem' interface includes various control and data signals such as memRead, memWrite, memAddr, and memData that are used to read from and write to memory during execution.
